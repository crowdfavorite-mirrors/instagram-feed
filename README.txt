== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display multiple Instagram feeds on my site or on the same page? =

Yep. You can display multiple Instagram feeds by using our built-in shortcode options, for example: `[instagram-feed id="12986477" cols=3]`.

= Can I display photos from more than one Instagram account in one single feed? =

Yep. You can just separate the IDs by commas, either in the User ID(s) field on the plugin's Settings page, or directly in the shortcode like so: `[instagram-feed id="12986477,13460080"]`.

= How do I find my Instagram Access Token and User ID =

We've made it super easy. Simply click on the big blue button on the Instagram Feed Settings page and log into your Instagram account. The plugin will then retrieve and display both your Access Token and User ID from Instagram.

You can also display photos from other peoples Instagram accounts. To find their Instagram User ID you can use [this tool](http://www.otzberg.net/iguserid/).

= My Instagram feed isn't displaying. Why not!? =

There are a few common reasons for this:

* **Your Access Token may not be valid.** Try clicking on the blue Instagram login button on the plugin's Settings page again and copy and paste the Instagram token it gives you into the plugin's Access Token field.
* **Your Instagram account may be set to private.** Your Instagram account may be set to private. Instagram doesn't allow photos from private Instagram accounts to be displayed publicly.
* **Your User ID may not be valid**. Be sure you're not using your Instagram username instead of your User ID. You can find your Instagram User ID by using [this tool](http://www.otzberg.net/iguserid/).
* **The plugin’s JavaScript file isn’t being included in your page.** This is most likely because your WordPress theme is missing the WordPress [wp_footer](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_footer) function which is required for plugins to be able to add their JavaScript files to your page. You can fix this by opening your theme's **footer.php** file and adding the following directly before the closing </body> tag: `<?php wp_footer(); ?>`
* **Your website may contain a JavaScript error which is preventing JavaScript from running.** The plugin uses JavaScript to load the Instagram photos into your page and so needs JavaScript to be running in order to work. You would need to remove any existing JavaScript errors on your website for the plugin to be able to load in your feed.

If you're still having an issue displaying your feed then please open a ticket in the [Support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/instagram-feed 'Instagram Feed Support Forum') with a link to the page where you're trying to display the Instagram feed and, if possible, a link to your Instagram account.

= Are there any security issues with using an Access Token on my site? =

Nope. The Access Token used in the plugin is a "read only" token, which means that it could never be used maliciously to manipulate your Instagram account.

= Can I view the full-size photos or play Instagram videos directly on my website?  =

This is a feature of the [Pro version](http://smashballoon.com/instagram-feed/ 'Instagram Feed Pro') of the plugin, which allows you to view the photos in a pop-up lightbox, support videos, display captions, display photos by hashtag + more!

= How do I embed my Instagram Feed directly into a WordPress page template? =

You can embed your Instagram feed directly into a template file by using the WordPress [do_shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode) function: `<?php echo do_shortcode('[instagram-feed]'); ?>`.

= What are the available shortcode options that I can use to customize my Instagram feed? =
